## Statement of Business Task:
*Smart devices are a big part of people’s everyday life. As a smart device manufacturer, Bellabeat can benefit from learning the trend of smart device usage and make data-driven business strategies to explore opportunities for growth.*

My goal is to look at datasets to find out:
* How are customers using other fitness trackers, in their daily life?
* What particular features seem to be the most heavily used?
* What features do Bellabeat products already have that consumers want, and how do we focus marketing on those aspects?

## Preparing the Data
* **Data Source, Licensing**:
  * The data used for this Case Study is the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data which is taken from Kaggle made available by Möbius.
  * This dataset is under CC0: Public Domain license meaning the creator has waive his right to the work under the copyright law.
  * The dataset has in total 18 files in .csv format organized in long format.

* **ROCCC (Reliabilty, Originality, Comprehensive, Current, Cited) Analysis**:
  * **Reliability**: Since the data was collected from a group of 30 people and the gender not being known, the chances of bias being included in the analysis increases. Thus the Reliability of the Data becomes ***Low***.
  * **Originality**: The data is provided by a third party who in this case is Möbius. This makes the originality of the data ***Low***.
  * **Comprehensive**: The dataset does contain mulitiple columns like calories used, daily activity etc., but it also misses out on fields like age, gender, etc. This makes the comprehensiveness of the data ***Medium***.
  * **Current**: The data set is around 5 years old. Since this period does not drastically change the way people function the currentness of the data is ***Medium***.
  * **Cited**: The data set is highly documented, and these datasets are considered as crowdsourcing data generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Therefore, the dataset is ***Highly*** cited.

Focus is on daily usage of the Fitbit device as it should provide a high-level insight on the usage pattern of smart devices. Thus the following files from the dataset has been selected:

* dailyActivity_merged.csv
* dailyCalories_merged.csv
* dailyIntensities_merged.csv
* dailySteps_merged.csv
* sleepDay_merged.csv
* weightLogInfo_merged.csv

## Process the Data
* **Loading the files**:

    ```
    daily_activity <- read.csv("C:/Users/yaswa/Documents/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
    daily_calories <- read.csv("C:/Users/yaswa/Documents/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyCalories_merged.csv")
    daily_intensities <- read.csv("C:/Users/yaswa/Documents/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
    daily_steps <- read.csv("C:/Users/yaswa/Documents/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailySteps_merged.csv")
    sleep_day <- read.csv("C:/Users/yaswa/Documents/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")
    weight_log <- read.csv("C:/Users/yaswa/Documents/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
